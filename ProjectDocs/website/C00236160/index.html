                    <p>I’ve always wanted to share my passion for Game Creation with friends and family. It's a daunting prospect for many unfamiliar with the complexity that comes with modern Games Development.
                        <br><br>Inspired by this idea, my aim was to create user friendly software that would remove the skill barrier needed to experience what it’s like to create your own game.
                        
                       <br><br> A further goal of mine was to create software that could be used to demonstrate the possibilities of game programming to aspiring developers and those considering an academic journey in Games design and programming. 
                        With this in mind I wanted to create a versatile game editor with languages and libraries such as C++, YAML and SFML that prospective students would become familiar with, within their first couple of years in an academic setting.
                       <br><br> 
                        My overall motivation was to create a piece of software that could be used at open days and college career fairs to give potential students a flavour of what Game Design and Development entails.

                                        I think with further development this No-Code Game Editor could be a robust piece of software
                                        that could be used to showcase Game Development courses and to encourage Novice programmars
                                        into the field.
                                        Aside from that i think it could also be a fun piece of software for those who enjoy level creation and simulation games
                                        that encourage unique creations.

                        <p>I am currently in my 4th year of an Honours BSc in Computer Games Development at 
                            SETU, South East Technological University, Carlow.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I have experience in languages that include C++, C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript and python. 
                            I have used IDEs including Visual Studio, VS Code, Anvil and Jupyter Notebook. 
                            I have two years experience with the Unity Game Engine for both 2D and 3D development in an academic setting. 
                            <br><br>Other tools I have used include pandas for data analysis, yaml for data storage, github and git 
                            for source and version control, as well as Jira for project management.
